# ChE-320: Bioreactor Modeling and Simulation ðŸŒ±ðŸ”¬

Welcome to the repository for ChE-320, where you'll find projects related to bioreactor modeling and simulation. This repository is designed to store all the assignments, projects, and related materials for the course.

## About the Course

ChE-320 focuses on the principles of bioreactor design, modeling, and simulation. Throughout this course, we explore various aspects of bioprocess engineering, including microbial growth kinetics, mass transfer, reactor design, and process control strategies. This repository serves as a hub for all our course-related projects and assignments.

## Projects

### Project 1: Introduction to Bioreactor Modeling
   - **Description**: Introduction to basic concepts of bioreactor modeling using simple systems.
   - **Members**: Younes, Anna, Pauline, [Your Name]
   - **Files**: `README.md`, `project1_report.pdf`, `project1_code.py`, etc.

   *More projects will be added as we progress through the course.*

Feel free to explore the materials in this repository for learning purposes, reference, or inspiration for your own projects.
