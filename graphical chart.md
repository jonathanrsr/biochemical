# Graphical Parameters for Python Plots 📊

This document outlines the standard graphical parameters to use for creating plots in Python for our ChE-320 projects.

## Line Plot Parameters 📈

- **Line Width**: 
  - Use a line width of `2` for main data lines.
  - Use a line width of `1` for auxiliary lines or reference lines.

- **Line Style**:
  - Use solid lines (`-`) for main data lines.
  - Use dashed lines (`--`) for auxiliary or reference lines.

## Scatter Plot Parameters 🔍

- **Marker Size**:
  - Use a marker size of `6` for main data points.
  - Adjust marker size accordingly for clarity but avoid very large markers.

- **Marker Style**:
  - Use circular markers (`o`) for main data points.
  - Adjust marker style based on clarity and aesthetic preferences.

## Color Scheme 🎨

- **Main Color**:
  - Use a consistent main color for primary data lines or markers, such as `blue`, `green`, or `red`.

- **Auxiliary Color**:
  - Use a distinct color for auxiliary lines or markers, such as `gray` or `black`.

- **Color Palette**:
  - Utilize a color palette with sufficient contrast for multi-series plots.

## Graph Size and Layout 📐

- **Figure Size**:
  - Optimal figure size is `10x6 inches` (width x height) for single plots.
  - Adjust figure size based on the complexity of the plot and space requirements.

- **Layout**:
  - Utilize clear and concise layouts with proper axis labels and titles.
  - Adjust spacing between subplots as needed for clarity.

## Font and Text Parameters 📝

- **Font Size**:
  - Use a font size of `12` for axis labels and titles.
